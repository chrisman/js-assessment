here are my solutions to [js-assessment](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment)

not all of it is pretty.

in fact very little of it is pretty.

sorry for not making it prettier.

## notes

When I thought about it, I made little notes in the solutions as I went along.

More generally my main thoughts about this assessment is that it's pretty dated. A good future project might be to rework some of the questions to assess for knowledge of and familiarity with more modern features of the language.

Overall I had fun with the exercises. Some of them were straight language familiarity. Some of them were pretty algorithmic.

Overall three out of five stars: ⭐️⭐️⭐️
